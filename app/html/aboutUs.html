    <h1>Discrete Probability Calculator v1.0</h1>
  </div>

  <h2>WHO WE ARE:</h2>

  <h4>Team members:</h4>
  <P>Vuochlang Chang, Patrick Tsai, Zhicheng Zhou</P>

  <h4>Group information:</h4>
  <p> Fall 2020, Junior students at Washington state university of Vancouver</p>

  <h4>Project Information:</h4>
  <p>The <b>Discrete Probability Calculator (DPC)</b> is a group project designed for a class <u>CS 320 -
    Fundamentals of Software Engineering</u>. It is based on 4 requirements as followed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is a web application</li>
    <li>It has a landing page that helps a user to understand what the application is about</li>
    <li>Besides the landing page, it has multiple other pages</li>
    <li>It has some data to maintain/manipulate</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

  <p>For this project, we are creating a web-based calculator that calculates five different discrete distributions
      based on user's selection and inputs. The <b c>Discrete Probability Calculator</b> is a simple website-based application
      that users can use to calculate the probability of the discrete distribution. There are multiple ways where the
      user can access the calculations for each distribution.
  </p>

  <p>The overall goals of the system are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide easy access to the users to calculate discrete probabilities;
      Users can access DPC website through any browsers whether from their smartphones or computers</li>
      <li>To provide as another option from a TI-84 calculator or other versions</li>
      <li>To help users to understand each probability better with the Help sections</li>
      <li>To improve our understanding of building a web application that interacts with user input</li>
    </ul>

  <p>The DPC system is <u>intended for study purposes</u>, its intended use is for student/academic questions. However, the
    DPC system is NOT intended to be used as a tool to make any real-life decisions, as that any probabilities derived
    from the program should not be used to make important life decisions.</p><br>
