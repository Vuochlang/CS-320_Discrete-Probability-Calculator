The average number of homes sold by the Acme Realty company is 2 homes per day. What is the probability that exactly 3 homes will be sold tomorrow?

Solution: This is a Poisson experiment in which we know the following:

位 = 2; since 2 homes are sold per day, on average.
x = 3; since we want to find the likelihood that 3 homes will be sold tomorrow.
e = 2.71828; since e is a constant equal to approximately 2.71828.
We plug these values into the Poisson formula as follows:

P(x; 位) = (e^-位) (位^x) / x!

P(3; 2) = (2.71828-2) (23) / 3!

P(3; 2) = (0.13534) (8) / 6

P(3; 2) = 0.180

Thus, the probability of selling 3 homes tomorrow is 0.180 .
