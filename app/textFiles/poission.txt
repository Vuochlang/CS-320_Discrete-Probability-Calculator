Experiments yielding nuymerical values of a random variable X, the number of outcomes occurring during a given time
interval or in a specified region, are called Poisson experiments. The given time interval may be of any length, such as
a minute, a day, a week, a month, or even a year. For example, a Poisson experiment can generate observations for the
random variable X representing the number of telephone calls received per hour by an office, the number of days school
is closed due to snow during the winter... X might represent the number of field mice per acre, the number of bacteria
in a given culture, or the number of typing errors per page. A Poisson experiment is derived from the Poisson process
and possesses the following properties.

Properties of the Poisson Process

1. The number of outcomes occurring in one time interval or specified region of space is independent of the number that
occur in any other disjoint time interval or region. In this sense we say that the Poisson process has no memory.

2. The probability that a single outcome will occur during a very short time interval or in a small region is
proportional to the length of the time interval or the size of the region and does not depend on the number of outcomes
occuring outside this time interval or region.

3. The probability that more than one outcome will occur in such a short time interval or fall in such a small region
is negligible.

The number X of outcomes occurring during a Poisson experiment is called a Poisson random variable, and its probability
distribution is called the Poisson distribution. The mean number of outcomes is computed from mu = lambda*t, where t is
the specific "time," "distance," "area," or "volume" of interest. Since the probabilities depend on lambda, the rate of
occurrence of outcomes, we shall denote them by p(x;lambda*t)... The following formula is used for computing Poisson
probabilities.

equation:
P(x; μ) = [(e^-μ) * (μ^x)] / x!
