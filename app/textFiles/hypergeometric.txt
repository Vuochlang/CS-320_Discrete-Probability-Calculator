The simplest way to view the distinction between the binomial distribution and the hypergeometric distribution is to
note the way the sampling is done. The types of applications for the hypergeometric are very similar to those for the
binomial distribution... in the case of the binomial distribution, independence among trials is required... the sampling
must be done with replacement of each item after it is observed. On the otherhand, the hypergeometric distribution does
not require independence and is based on sampling done without replacement.

Applications for the hypergeometric distribution are foud in many areas, with heavy use in acceptance sampling,
electronic testing, and quality assurance... in many of these fields, testing is done at the expense of the item being
tested. That is, the item is destroyed and hence cannot be replaced in the sample. Thus, sampling without replacement
is necessary...

In general, we are interested in the probability of selecting x successes from the k items labeled successes and n-x
failures from the N-k items labeled failures when a random sample of size n is selected from N items. This is known as
a hypergeometric experiment, that is, one that possesses the following two properties:

1. A random sample of size n is selected without replacement from N items.
2. Of the N items, k may be classified as successes and N-k are classified as failures.

The number X of successes of a hypergeometric experiment is called a hypergeometric random variable. Accordingly, the
probability distribution of the hypergeometric variable is called the hypergeometric distribution, and its values are
denoted by h(x;N,n,k), since they depend on the number of successes k in the set N from which we select n items.

equation:
h(x; N, n, k) = [combination(k; x) * combination(N-k; n-x)]/combination(N; n)
