You are surveying people exiting from a polling booth and asking them if they voted independent.
The probability (p) that a person voted independent is 20%. What is the probability that 15 people must be asked before
you can find 5 people who voted independent?

Step 1: Find p, r and X.
We are given (in the question) that p = 20%(.2) and r = 5. The number of failures, X, is 15 â€“ 5 = 10.

Step 2: Insert those values from Step 1 into the formula:
p(x;r;p) = (x+r-1; r-1) * p^r * (1-p)^x

Step 3: Solve. The first part (14 over 4) is a combination.
1001*.25*.810 = 0.034.
