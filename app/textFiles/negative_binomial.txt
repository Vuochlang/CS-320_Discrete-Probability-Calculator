Let us consider an experiment where the properties are the same as those listed for a binomial experiment, with the
exception that the trials will be repeated untiil a fixed number of successes occur. Therefore, instead of the
probability of x successes in n trials, where n is fixed, we are now interested in the probability that the kth success
occurs on the xth trial...

The number X of trials required to produce k successes in a negative binomial experiment is called a negative binomial
random variable, and its probability distribution is called the negative binomial distribution. Since its probabilities
depend on the number of successes desired and the probability of a success on a given trial we shall denote them by
b*(x;k,p)... Since the trials are independent we can multiply all the probabilities corresponding to each desired
outcome. Each success occurs with prooability p and each failure with probability q=1-p.

p(x;r;p) = (x+r-1; r-1) * p^r * (1-p)^x
