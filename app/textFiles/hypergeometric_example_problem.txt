Suppose we randomly select 5 cards without replacement from an ordinary deck of playing cards. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 red cards (i.e., hearts or diamonds)?

Solution:

N = 52; since there are 52 cards in a deck.
k = 26; since there are 26 red cards in a deck.
n = 5; since we randomly select 5 cards from the deck.
x = 2; since 2 of the cards we select are red.
We plug these values into the hypergeometric formula as follows:
h(x; N, n, k) = [ kCx ] [ N-kCn-x ] / [ NCn ]

h(2; 52, 5, 26) = [ 26C2 ] [ 26C3 ] / [ 52C5 ]

h(2; 52, 5, 26) = [ 325 ] [ 2600 ] / [ 2,598,960 ]

h(2; 52, 5, 26) = 0.32513
Thus, the probability of randomly selecting 2 red cards is 0.32513.
