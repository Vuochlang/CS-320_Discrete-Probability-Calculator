# CS-320-Fundamentals of Software Engineering
# Discrete Probability Calculator v1.0
Description: For this project, we are creating a web-based calculator that calculates five different discrete distributions based on user's selection and inputs. The Discrete Probability Calculator is a simple website-based application that users can use to calculate the probability of the discrete distribution. There are multiple ways where the user can access the calculations for each distribution.

The overall goals of the system are:

To provide easy access to the users to calculate discrete probabilities; Users can access DPC website through any browsers whether from their smartphones or computers

To provide as another option from a TI-84 calculator or other versions

To help users to understand each probability better with the Help sections

To improve our understanding of building a web application that interacts with user input.

The DPC system is intended for study purposes, its intended use is for student/academic questions. However, the DPC system is NOT intended to be used as a tool to make any real-life decisions, as that any probabilities derived from the program should not be used to make important life decisions.
